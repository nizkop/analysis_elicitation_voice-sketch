# things to say:
- choose the language that feels natural to you for using a spreadsheet app 
- consent form (needs to be signed on paper)

# things to say in exemplary tasks:

## task 1:
- always this spreadsheet as a start
- task: find difference to this start page in "after page"
- **yellow mark** is NOT the change, it is the mark for you to see the real change
   * **dark yellow** marked are cells, that have been changed
- feel free to **switch back and forth multiple times**
- if you do not understand the tasks/... -> skip it 
- task: think about how you would execute the task, using sketch and/or voice
- for example, here I would choose **voice**: 
    - go to "before" sheet 
    - "increase height of line 2"
    - imagine app switches automatically to "after" sheet (it will not do so here, but your command is saved!)
    - Do not say "I would do...", but DO IT even if the app is not responding.
    - In case you want to redo your voice command, simply say so and we will have the information in the recording. 
- if asked for it: **sketch**: 
  - downward arrow at the edge, starting from line 2
 

## task 2: 
- sometimes there is a hint at the top of the screen (for equations)
- **light yellow** marked are cells, that are needed for the change in other cells (reference cells)
- for example, here I would choose **sketch**: 
    - go to "before" sheet (but both sheets are okay)
    - Ã˜ in cell K8
    - sketch, it does **not** have to be a **perfect** painting; only your idea is important
    - you can reset the drawing via the reset button if you want to start anew
    - drawing only works on the spreadsheet background

-> ready? 
- 20 tasks in total
- you can use EITHER voice OR sketch as shown in the examples; OR you can use combinations of it  !!! 
  (You may also choose the standard way using the computer mouse and/or menus of the program.)
- **START RECORDING** after task 2! 


additional information: 
- If you go back to a previous task, you do not see the sketches anymore; BUT is is saved! There is no need to do it again.
- Participants do not need to do task 1 and 2 (no going backward needed). 
- when internet problems occur, the app may appear to not load the "after" picture, but seemingly remains on the 
  startpage. In my experience, waiting a little bit and then switching back and forth some times fixes this. 
- The idea is for participants to draw on the marked sheet only and imagine, that the app switches to the "after" sheet 
  after it. But it seems people like to draw on the sheet, where they see the change. And since speeking is possible on 
 eather sheet, we decided to allow sketching on each sheet too. So no need to control on which sheet people draw. 
- Participants may tell you, that they would simply do tasks with a mouse/excel menu/... This will classify as a 
  GUI-choice later on and also is a valid solution for a task. Participants who tell you this, simply may go on after 
  that and do not need to formulate a sketch/voice solution.
